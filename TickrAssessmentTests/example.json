It is sweet revenge for a club where wounds are still raw after Rugby Australia cut them in 2017 following Sanzaar’s decision to reduce the number of Super Rugby teams from 18 to 15.</p> <p>In a way the Force are a major beneficiary of the Covid-19 pandemic, which shut down the multi-national competition in March last year. RA invited the Perth-based franchise back into the fold last year when it needed a fifth side for the domestic Super Rugby AU competition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/apr/20/the-hidden-cost-to-the-wallabies-of-pacific-island-inclusion-in-super-rugby\">The hidden cost to the Wallabies of Pacific Island inclusion in Super Rugby | Bret Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Force, in a sense, remain an invitational team but are no longer making up the numbers. </p> <p>One of the main reasons the other four Australian franchises supported the axing of a side four years ago was the realisation that the country lacked sufficient playing talent to continue to support five teams.</p> <p>With that in mind, RA has been happy to allow the Force to recruit a foreign legion of players to Perth – Argentinians, New Zealanders, South Africans, an Englishman and an Irishman. Many of the Force’s overseas recruits such as veteran Irish fullback Rob Kearney and former All Blacks centre Richard Kahui are at the end of their careers, but they have brought valuable experience to Perth.</p> <p>The Force, along with the Melbourne Rebels, were this year given special dispensation on the foreign player quota to address what Andy Marinos, RA’s CEO, described as “a player resource issue” at the two clubs.</p> <p>The benefit of the Force recruiting so many foreign players is that they will not raid the east coast teams the way they did when they entered Super Rugby in 2006.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b0ed5eb6908a5afd67d729e45fb880f7640fd1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b0ed5eb6908a5afd67d729e45fb880f7640fd1e/0_319_4777_2867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Kahui\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Kahui, one of the Force’s experienced overseas recruits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Kane/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Rebels entered the competition in 2011, RA also gave them foreign player dispensations to encourage them not to do what the Force had done in 2006, but the imports were exempt from the salary cap and the club soon found itself in a financial crisis. There is no suggestion the Force are heading down the same path. </p> <p>Ideally, it would be better for all of Australia’s teams to adhere to the same foreign player restrictions. If there are not enough quality Australian players to go around, then all the teams should be allowed to recruit more imports, not just one side, and the players should be come under the salary cap.</p> <p>After upsetting competition leaders the Queensland Reds 30-27 in the final round in Perth last Friday night, the Force, in no small part thanks to their foreign legion, now believe they can win the title. But they enjoyed an important psychological advantage against the Reds, which they will not have in the play-offs.</p> <p>The Force were fighting for their season, while the Reds had already secured a home final. The Reds wanted to achieve the prestige of completing the regular season undefeated, but it did not matter if they won or lost, which meant they were vulnerable against a team that had everything to play for.</p> <p>The Force deserved a lot of praise for fighting back after trailing 21-7 after 24 minutes, but the Reds’ decision-making in the final stages of the game was clearly influenced by the fact they had nothing to lose. Twice in the last four minutes, the Reds passed up point-blank shots at penalty goal, which would have levelled the score and sent the game into extra-time, instead opting for five metre scrums.</p> <p>The Reds received a penalty after the Force illegally wheeled the first scrum and opted for another set-piece. The Reds were then held up and the Force were awarded a scrum from which they kicked the ball out to end the game. If the Reds had not been assured of a home final, would they have taken the huge risk of an-all-or-nothing play to score a winning try? Or would they have kicked the penalty and backed themselves to prevail in extra time?</p> <p>On Saturday night the Force play the Brumbies, the most experienced play-off team in Australian Super Rugby history, in the qualifying final in Canberra and the ACT side’s mindset will be completely different in the sudden-death match. But whatever the result, the Force will have achieved a successful season, which should bring the franchise a step closer to full reconciliation with the rest of Australian rugby.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 27 April to correct the assertion that Western Force is not subject to salary cap rules enforceable by Rugby Australia</p></li> </ul>","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/h7me2","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee60118a9dc505a397c3dd2b3750f78007af4d9f/0_69_4643_2786/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2021/apr/27/australia-news-live-morrison-government-india-covid-wa-restrictions-flights-nsw","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-27T06:51:35Z","webTitle":"Australia news live updates: two more Indigenous deaths in custody confirmed; PM says flights from India suspended over Covid cases","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/apr/27/australia-news-live-morrison-government-india-covid-wa-restrictions-flights-nsw","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2021/apr/27/australia-news-live-morrison-government-india-covid-wa-restrictions-flights-nsw","fields":{"headline":"Australia news live updates: two more Indigenous deaths in custody confirmed; PM says flights from India suspended over Covid cases","trailText":"Deaths of Aboriginal inmates in NSW and Victoria reported; Australia to send health supplies to India after new coronavirus cases there topped 350,000 on Monday.

That’s what we’re doing. We’re pursuing peace for a free and open Indo-Pacific. All of the agency that we have as a country and as a government is designed to achieve that.</p> <p>But it’s also at the same time designed to ensure that Australia’s national interest always are advanced. And that’s we have invested considerably to ensure the capacity of our defence forces. Two per cent of our economy each year, the size of our economy, is spent each year ensuring we have a capable defence force in this country. That’s a significant increase from where we were when we came the government, when the size of our investments fell to below the levels before the second world war. </p> <p>We have restored that and we have done that to ensure that Australia’s national interest can always be protected.

That’s what is in their interests, ultimately, that’s what the government is doing, working with our partners in the region, working with as Asean, our strategic partners, that includes China, so we can have an open and peaceful trade community in the Indo-Pacific.

The whole process disproportionately hits the less well-off and criminalises the poor over the better-off.”</p> <p>She acknowledged that the police have a difficult job but noted that “since January there have been greater numbers of FPNs as police move more quickly to enforcement action, and because of a lack of legal clarity, likely greater numbers of incorrectly issued FPNs”.</p> <p><strong>Read more of Haroon Siddique’s report here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/27/all-covid-fines-in-england-should-be-reviewed-mps-say\">All Covid fines in England should be reviewed, MPs say</a></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/27/all-covid-fines-in-england-should-be-reviewed-mps-say\">All Covid fines in England should be reviewed, MPs say</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-608795118f08080a7ae6d15d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-27T05:48:34.761Z\">6.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Japan to open mass vaccination centre in Tokyo</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Japan </strong>will open a mass vaccination centre in central Tokyo next month ahead of this summer’s Olympic Games. </p> <p>No decision has been made on which vaccine will be used or how many people will get shots each day, the chief cabinet secretary, Katsunobu Kato, told reporters.</p> <p>“We will announce the details once the defence ministry and local authorities have come up with a plan,” Kato said. </p> <p>The government will also support inoculation efforts in Osaka, in western Japan, he added.</p> <p>Japan imposed a third state of emergency in its major population centres on Sunday, as the country attempts to combat a fourth wave of infections with less than three months until the Olympics begin. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-27T06:25:01.365Z\">at 7.25am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-608794598f08a84aa591f654\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-27T05:32:24.886Z\">6.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Thailand sets new daily record for Covid deaths</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Thailand </strong>on Tuesday reported 15 new coronavirus deaths, setting a new daily record for the third time in four days during a growing third wave of infections that has prompted new shutdowns in Bangkok and other areas.<br></p> <p>The health ministry also reported 2,179 new coronavirus cases, bringing total confirmed infections to 59,687 and fatalities to 163.</p> <p>Parks, gyms, cinemas and day-care centres in the capital Bangkok were ordered to shut from 26 April until 9 May.</p> <p>The country’s PM, Prayut Chan-o-cha,<strong> </strong>was fined for not wearing a mask after new restrictions came into force.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-608793d08f08505668d9c6fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-27T05:12:57.467Z\">6.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Even though India’s case load was down from Monday’s global record (323,144 new cases, down from 352,991) some medical experts warned it was due to reduced testing, not a reduced infection rate. </p> <p>“Please note that a huge fall in daily cases … is largely due to a heavy fall in testing.

The documentary features the archivists, archaeologists, volunteers and descendants who are searching for and restoring African American cemeteries and burial sites like East End or Sweet Briar plantation. Their efforts are a reclamation of the histories that have been buried and neglected by a dominant society keener on commemorating the slavers instead of the enslaved.</p> <p>“If you’re going to hold on so tight to these people who fought against freedom, we’re going to pick back up these people who you fought against,” Haley told the Guardian over a Zoom call alongside his Unmarked co-director Bennet.<strong> </strong>“That reclamation is only made necessary because there was such a concerted effort for Black people to not remember who they were; to not remember their heritage.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z43rjVtY_Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8z43rjVtY_Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Making Unmarked began in 2017 with a radio news story on East End cemetery that caught Bennet’s attention. The film-maker had just co-directed the reconciliation documentary Forgive – Don’t Forget, which follows an American who travels to Japan to return a samurai sword to the family it was taken from during the second world war. The film played at the Utopia film festival in Greenbelt, Maryland, where Chris Haley is executive director.</p> <p>Haley is also the director at Maryland State Archive. His occupational and personal interests in burial sites and uncovering African American history runs deep, which is why Bennet sought Haley out for a collaboration on Unmarked.</p> <p>“One of the main things an old school genealogist will do is go to cemeteries,” Haley said, explaining how that crucial landscape can help paint a picture or expand the scope of a historian or descendant’s search. “Not only do you hope to see the gravestone or the marker of that specific individual you’re looking for, but you’re hoping to see other people that you’re not aware of who are buried next to that person, who might be other family members.”</p> <p>Haley’s proximity to this subject isn’t limited to his research and interests as an archivist; it’s a family matter. His uncle is Alex Haley, the author behind the 1976 Pulitzer-winning novel Roots: The Saga of an American Family, which was a gateway to African American history for generations who consumed the text or watched its television adaptations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6ce928be84e8c7e170c6d86c1a411af67bcff9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6ce928be84e8c7e170c6d86c1a411af67bcff9d/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Unmarked\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In that novel, Alex Haley traces his own lineage back to an 18th-century ancestor, Kunta Kinte, the Gambian man enslaved and transported to America, where he rebelled against his slavers until having his foot cut off. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/feb/09/alex-haley-roots-reputation-authenticity\">veracity of Roots</a> has been the subject of scrutiny. The late Haley settled a plagiarism suit from the African author Harold Courlander and contended with doubts that some if not all the stories about Kunta Kinte that he said were passed down orally were fabrications.</p> <p>Whether or not Roots, which has near-biblical influence, is to be believed, the scrutiny it faced is indicative of a struggle to reconstruct the lives of people who were enslaved. For African Americans researching ancestry and history, the burial of their stories go beyond neglected cemeteries. Collecting artifacts from ancestry is monumentally challenging because enslaved people – and generations after – were dispossessed of property. Literature is limited because teaching a slave to read or write was discouraged if not outright illegal in southern states.</p> <p>“All we had as proof was oral history,” said Haley, “because that’s all we were allowed to have. The rush to disbelieve oral history is very hypocritical because you made us only rely on oral history.”</p> <p>In the absence of gravestones, mounds of earth or resilient periwinkle flowers that are commonly found at burial sites are used as landmarks. “We’ll be able to still tell our grandchildren and great grandchildren that Papa Hank was buried over there by the cherry tree to the right or by the pond to the left,” Haley said, mimicking the kind of instructions passed down orally that historians now rely on to find burial sites and more.</p> <p>Last week, Maryland officials announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/21/harriet-tubman-lost-maryland-home-discovered\">archaeologist Julie M Schablitsky located the area</a> where Harriet Tubman may have lived during her young adult years. Schablitsky followed land records to the general area where the cabin willed to Tubman’s father Ben Ross once stood. Her excavation team’s exhaustive search was coming up short until their metal detector happened upon a buried 50-cent coin dated 1808. That put them on the right path towards an area where they found ceramic shards that likely belonged to Tubman’s family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f58f8239a5d855facbe2dacb23c7c2b68b355642\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f58f8239a5d855facbe2dacb23c7c2b68b355642/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is the effort it takes to retrace Harriet Tubman’s life, a sign of how difficult the uphill battle is for everyone else.</p> <p>Schablitsky appears in Unmarked, helping descendants locate their ancestors at a Virginia plantation called Belvoir. She explains the weight of spaces and how – in the absence of anything else – seemingly random artifacts can be used to reconstruct lives; and in turn African American history.</p> <p>Schablitsky also introduces the story of a young woman named Cinderella Brogden who was enslaved at Belvoir. Cinderella married a free Black man named Abraham Brogden. In 1848, when she was 24 years old, Cinderella ran away from Belvoir with Abraham after learning her owner had plans to sell her. They were caught. Abraham was sent to prison for aiding Cinderella’s escape, but locals petitioned for his early release. Cinderella was sold and died under unknown circumstances.</p> <p>The only reason their story is known is because Chris Haley discovered the runaway slave ads and court documents in Maryland’s archives. “It struck me that her name was Cinderella,” said Haley, “because people aren’t named in a void. What did that mean?” Haley uses America’s tragic Cinderella story as yet another example why concerted efforts to find and restore unmarked cemeteries and piece together African American history is so important. There are many more stories like theirs lost among the weeds.</p> <p>But he also argued that the reclamation conversation goes beyond unpacking the trauma and injustice of slavery. In Unmarked, a Sweet Briar descendent named Bethany Pace describes a sense of pride for the contributions her ancestors made; the bricks they laid to build nearby buildings, and the institutions and wealth created by African Americans who were enduring injustice. There is a sense of ownership and self-determination that comes with reclaiming these narratives, as well as honouring the loves and remains of people who were treated as property.</p> <p>“You don’t have ownership of your body in life, so at least we have it in death,” Haley said. “We are given this area where we can bury our ancestors. And that’s sacred to us.”</p> <ul> <li><p>Unmarked is available to rent digitally in the US with a UK date to be announced</p></li> </ul>","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/h8vyt","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/77077ce62dcee1832b78c9d5c270d43203724f3d/120_0_1800_1080/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/apr/27/gold-coast-suspected-murder-suicide-victims-family-want-help-bringing-body-back-to-melbourne","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-27T06:24:10Z","webTitle":"Gold Coast suspected murder-suicide victim’s family want help bringing body back to Melbourne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/27/gold-coast-suspected-murder-suicide-victims-family-want-help-bringing-body-back-to-melbourne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/apr/27/gold-coast-suspected-murder-suicide-victims-family-want-help-bringing-body-back-to-melbourne","fields":{"headline":"Gold Coast suspected murder-suicide victim’s family want help bringing body back to Melbourne","trailText":"Family of Lourdi Ramadan, who was found dead along with her partner, Craig Bouma, want to give her ‘farewell she deserves’","body":"<p>The family of a Gold Coast woman who was found dead inside a wooden chest last week in what police suspect is a murder-suicide are pleading for help to bring her body back to Melbourne.</p> <p>Lourdi “Lordy” Ramadan’s body was found at the apartment in Labrador she shared with her partner, Craig Bouma, who was also found dead there.</p> <p>Police were called to the apartment on Friday after concerned family members raised the alarm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/27/fewer-than-90-domestic-violence-specialist-police-officers-in-queensland-to-handle-107000-cases\">Fewer than 90 domestic violence specialist police officers in Queensland to handle 107,000 cases</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Officers arrived at the unit and found the body of Bouma, 53, with a note.</p> <p>They found the body of Ramadan, 48, concealed in the chest, and believe it may have been there for more than a week.</p> <p>Bouma was reportedly Ramadan’s partner and carer, who helped manage her chronic illness.</p> <p>Her brother, Alex Ramadan, has set up a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/bring-lordy-home?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp%20share-sheet&amp;fbclid=IwAR1dHkfY446ro5-CYFudZF8iHXxdRxMj6gGKbWE8LiirZVnvBYAxzF4QrTI\">GoFundMe page</a> to help bring his sister’s body home to Melbourne, writing that the money would help get her the “farewell she deserves”.</p> <p>“Unfortunately my beautiful sister Lordy had her life cut short,” he wrote. “Trying to raise some money to help my elderly parents cover the costs of bringing her body home to VIC and giving her the farewell she deserves.”</p> <p>Lourdi Ramadan and Bouma had reportedly been in a relationship for the past decade, and had moved from Victoria to Queensland several years ago.</p> <p>Gold Coast district detective inspector Chris Ahearn said on the weekend that the couple was not known to police.</p> <p>“There is no domestic violence orders in place and there is a suggestion that the male person was also a carer for the female person, so one of the lines of investigation is into the medical condition of the female person, prior to her tragic death,” he said.</p> <p>“We are treating the deaths of these people as suspicious and there is some early indications of the male person being responsible for the death of the female person.</p> <p>“That is the focus of our investigation.”</p> <p>Ramadan’s family has been informed about the contents of the note Bouma wrote before his death.</p> <p>Alex Ramadan told the <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/breaking-news/devastated-family-pleas-for-help-to-bring-murdered-daughter-home/news-story/88148961e078ba99dcb313b14ca5849e\">Courier Mail</a> he was furious at what he had been told Bouma had written.</p> <p>“In the letter apparently it said he wanted to get rid of her pain and suffering and that’s what he’s done,” he said. “That’s what we’ve been told.

But the government needs to ensure that rules are clear, enforcement is fair and that mistakes in the system can be rectified. None of that is the case in respect of Covid-19 fixed penalty notices.</p> <p>“This means we’ve got an unfair system with clear evidence that young people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/27/police-in-england-and-wales-twice-as-likely-to-fine-young-bame-men-during-lockdown\">those from certain ethnic minority backgrounds</a>, men and the most socially deprived are most at risk. Whether people feel the FPN is deserved or not, those who can afford it are likely to pay a penalty to avoid criminality. Those who can’t afford to pay face a criminal record along with all the resulting consequences for their future development. The whole process disproportionately hits the less well-off and criminalises the poor over the better-off.”</p> <p>She acknowledged that the police have a difficult job but noted that “since January there have been greater numbers of FPNs as police move more quickly to enforcement action, and because of a lack of legal clarity, likely greater numbers of incorrectly issued FPNs”.</p> <p>Out of 325 cases reviewed by the Crown Prosecution Service in the first two months of the year, which were brought under the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/350/contents/made\">Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations</a> and reached open court, 86 (26%) were found to have been incorrectly charged, the committee found in a report. But this is likely to have underestimated the scale of the problem, as many people are likely to have been put off challenging an FPN in court because of the risk of a criminal conviction. The committee says people should instead be able to challenge fines by way of administrative review or appeal.</p> <p>The number of FPNs issued by the police was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/25/covid-fines-surge-in-england-and-wales-as-police-adopt-hardline-approach\">at its highest during the January to March 2021 lockdown period</a>, the report states. It says the government should commission analysis of who FPNs have been issued to because they have “disproportionately penalised some groups over others”.</p> <p>Large fixed penalties awarded irrespective of the individual’s circumstances “risk being inherently unjust” and the current system “criminalises the poor over the wealthy”, the committee members warn.</p> <p>They say there should a graduated approach to FPN amounts and people should not face a criminal record for non-payment, questioning “why a breach of the coronavirus regulations would be relevant to someone’s future employment prospects or ability to travel to certain countries”.</p> <p>The committee also says it is “astonishing” that every single criminal charge brought under <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/contents\">the Coronavirus Act</a> has been found to have been brought incorrectly. Unlike the regularly updated and amended regulations, the act has not changed since March last year, moving the members to say: “There is no reason for such mistakes to continue.”</p> <p>Harman said: “This committee is calling on the government to distinguish clearly between advice, guidance and the law. Fixed penalty notices were originally designed to deal with straightforward matters of law – easily understood by all involved. But our inquiry has demonstrated is that coronavirus regulations are neither straightforward nor easily understood either by those who have to obey them or the police who have to enforce them.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “Our police officers have worked tirelessly to keep us safe during the pandemic. They have played a crucial role to protect the public and save lives, always engaging with and encouraging of the vast majority of people trying to do the right thing before if necessary, enforcing the rules.</p> <p>“While the majority of the public are continuing to play their part, it is right that those who most flagrantly breach the rules face consequences, which could include a criminal record.</p> <p>“Throughout the pandemic, we have maintained a constant dialogue with police forces across the country to help them implement the regulations.” </p>","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/h7p5p","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/603758c92c1c0fcea1dbb34c66d43d63d55ea619/0_292_4409_2647/500.jpg"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2021/apr/27/norton-refuses-to-refund-me-550-for-an-unused-antivirus-subscription","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-27T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Norton refuses to refund me £550 for an unused antivirus subscription","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/apr/27/norton-refuses-to-refund-me-550-for-an-unused-antivirus-subscription","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2021/apr/27/norton-refuses-to-refund-me-550-for-an-unused-antivirus-subscription","fields":{"headline":"Norton refuses to refund me £550 for an unused antivirus subscription","trailText":"It has charged me for seven years despite me not asking to renew","body":"<p><strong>I recently discovered that for the last seven years I have been paying for an unused antivirus subscription to Norton.

Too far away, you’re out in the cold. So the party spends a lot of time talking about the fire, managing the fire, orbiting the fire. It takes a lot of energy out of the party.”</p> <p>Barack Obama’s election in 2008 was the last time Democrats swept the board of White House, House of Representatives and Senate. On that occasion conservatives exploited the financial crisis to stir resentment about government spending, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/05/us-midterm-elections-2010-tea-party-movement\">giving rise to the Tea Party</a> and winning back the House in the midterm elections.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s a lot easier to grift on people’s fears of other people and prey on their concerns about culture wars that really don’t exist</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Steele</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But this time looks very different. Republicans were forced to watch from the sidelines as Biden oversaw the distribution of 200m coronavirus vaccination doses while bringing down unemployment. They failed to find a coherent line of attack on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/10/joe-biden-covid-relief-bill-passed-analysis\">$1.9tn Covid relief package,</a> which opinion polls showed was popular with the public, including Republican voters.</p> <p>Instead of setting out a clear alternative agenda, the party has spent much of the past three months wading into issues that animate the Trump base, such as the rights of transgender athletes and the withdrawal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/mar/02/six-dr-seuss-books-cease-publication-racism\">six Dr Seuss books</a> due to racist content. In this policy vacuum “cancel culture” and “wokeness” are the rallying cries while the loudest voices, such as Congresswoman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/18/democrats-holly-mccormack-republican-extremist-marjorie-taylor-greene\">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> and the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, are also the most extreme.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/06/michael-steele-donald-trump-republican-party-interview\">Michael Steele,</a> former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: “When you don’t have a plan you go to what you think you’re good at and that is creating tensions and divisions that move people emotionally rather than practically. So the reality is, you’re going to talk about Dr Seuss when you have nothing to say about Covid-19. You’re going to talk about transgender issues when you have nothing to say on infrastructure<em>.”</em></p> <p>He added: “It’s a lot easier to grift on people’s fears of other people and prey on their concerns about culture wars that really don’t exist. But at the end of the day, when you’re watching family members get sick and die, when you’ve lost your business, when you’ve been fired from your job in the midst of a global pandemic, you don’t give a damn about Dr Seuss.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"96dd46ef127743ae0a5e01d0b62cdda77e7c3bab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96dd46ef127743ae0a5e01d0b62cdda77e7c3bab/0_143_4240_2545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘So the reality is, you’re going to talk about Dr Seuss when you have nothing to say about Covid-19.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘So the reality is, you’re going to talk about Dr Seuss when you have nothing to say about Covid-19’ – Michael Steele.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Nacion/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Republicans have also passed new voting restriction laws to appease activists pushing Trump’s “big lie” that the 2020 election was stolen from him. When corporations raised objections to such measures in Georgia, the party lashed out and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/05/mitch-mcconnell-voting-restrictions-corporate-america\">called into question</a> its longstanding relationship with big business – a further sign of identity crisis under Trump.</p> <p>Its efforts to stall Biden’s momentum, for example by focusing on a sharp increase of migrants at the US-Mexico border, have fallen short; the president has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/15/joe-biden-approval-rating-president-first-100-days\">a 59% approval rating,</a> according to Pew Research Center study.</p> <p>Trump’s charge of “Sleepy Joe” has failed to stick as the 78-year-old president’s verbal slips prove relatively rare, while Biden’s identity as a white male has shielded him from base instincts that were whipped up against Obama and Hillary Clinton. And his longstanding reputation as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/opinion/biden-democratic-party.html\">a non-threatening moderate</a> has made it hard for Republicans to credibly define him as a dangerous radical.</p> <p>Steele commented: “This goes back to the campaign. They tried to paint this guy a certain way and put him in a box. He’s just not boxable the way politically Republicans would like to box him in: try to create this impression this guy is some leftwing dictator or wolf in sheep’s clothing.</p> <p>“People have a 50-year relationship with this man. They know who he is and so that has not helped them the way it may have served them with someone like Barack Obama, who the country largely didn’t know when he first came on to the scene.”</p> <p>The iron laws of politics suggest that, if Republicans remain patient, Biden will suffer a major stumble or setback sooner or later. The coronavirus may prove stubbornly durable, the border crisis may flare up again or there may be some entirely unpredictable lightning strike. Even in the current climate, Republicans remain confident of winning back the House next year given that a first-term president’s party <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=114316346\">usually struggles in the midterms.</a></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump is still sucking all of the oxygen out of the room for Republicans</p> <footer> <cite>Monika McDermott</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nothing can be taken for granted, however, in a world shaken by both Trump’s election and a pandemic that cost half a million American lives. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobShrum?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Bob Shrum,</a> a Democratic strategist, said: “Talking about the border when everybody cares about Covid and the economy, talking about Dr Seuss, is not the way to electoral victory.</p> <p>“Biden is on a pretty steady course to deal with the pandemic and get the economy open and, if he does that and does it well, he has a chance to be the third president in a hundred years to do well in the midterms after his initial election.”</p> <p>Typically a party that has taken an electoral beating holds a postmortem and regroups in an effort to broaden its appeal.

Could it be that the rich world was more vulnerable, somehow, because its populations were older, or more individualistic, or had forgotten to be scared of infectious disease?</p> <p>Even then, some were warning that the worst was yet to come, once the disease took hold in poorer countries. World Bank analysts Philip Schellekens and Diego Sourrouille, for example, predicted a “massive shift” in disease burden to the developing world. Just in terms of demography, they said, you’d expect those countries to account for around 70% of deaths. As things stand they account for a little over <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fibke/status/1384822738561421314?s=21\">half of it</a>, which is probably an underestimate due to variations in data quality – and the pandemic is far from over.</p> <p>Last week saw more than <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/weekly-covid-cases?tab=table\">5.8 million new cases</a> of Covid globally, the highest number yet. More than 3 million people have now died from Covid, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which also reports that infections and hospitalisations in those aged 25 to 59 are increasing at an alarming rate. “It took nine months to reach 1 million deaths, four months to reach 2 million, and three months to reach 3 million,” WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/director-generals-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19-19-april-2021\">said last week</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/22/revealed-big-shortfall-in-covax-covid-vaccine-sharing-scheme\">Revealed: big shortfall in Covax Covid vaccine-sharing scheme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sharpest upticks in recent weeks have been seen in south-east Asia – driven <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/21/why-is-india-seeing-such-a-huge-surge-in-covid-19-cases\">in large part by India</a> – and the eastern Mediterranean and western Pacific regions, but the situation is also very bad in Latin America. People who migrated to Brazil in search of work are now <a href=\"https://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/miscellaneous/covid-19/fleeing-the-pandemic-in-brazil-haitians-are-stopped-at-peruvian-border/\">reported to be fleeing</a> the humanitarian catastrophe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/mar/30/neighbors-shun-brazil-covid-response-bolsonaro\">that is unfolding there</a>.</p> <p>Infection rates are <a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases\">still high</a> in many wealthy countries – including the US and much of Europe – but the mood is more upbeat: as vaccines roll out, many people feel the worst is behind them. Some US states have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/02/texas-governor-ends-mask-mandate-and-declares-it\">rashly lifted</a> their mask mandates. The British government gave the most optimistic signal it could think of earlier this month, when it reopened pubs. And Covid-19 is slipping down the headlines, reflecting not just fatigue at having to respect the rules, but fatigue at the very mention of the disease. Fear concentrates the mind, but fear is dissipating; we’d rather read about Tory sleaze, or the doomed European Super League.</p> <p>Again, you could be forgiven for asking, is there one pandemic or two? Only now the question has an entirely different meaning. The tables have turned.</p> <p>In reality, there was only ever one pandemic. We tend to think of it in terms of national impacts and responses, at best regional ones, but for it to make sense you have to stand back and look at it globally. For all its idiosyncrasies, Covid will stay true to type in at least one way: like pandemics throughout history, it will hammer the poorest hardest.</p> <p>Depending on where you’re standing, there are genuine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/12/ignore-scare-stories-covid-vaccines-variants-scientific-optimism\">reasons to be cheerful</a>. The vaccines are effective in mitigating the disease and there’s growing evidence that they slow its spread too. But their rollout is extremely uneven. A <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations\">quarter of Americans</a> have been fully vaccinated to date, compared with fewer than <a href=\"https://africacdc.org/covid-19-vaccination/\">2% of Ghanaians</a>. An Israeli is 20 times more likely to have received a single vaccine dose than a Palestinian, and there are still countries that haven’t administered any.</p> <p>There’s unevenness within countries too, in part due to vaccine hesitancy. A <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/report-section/kff-washington-post-frontline-health-care-workers-survey-vaccine-intentions/\">recent survey</a> of US healthcare workers showed that 48% had yet to be vaccinated, and 18% didn’t intend to be. Partly because they have seen relatively few Covid deaths locally, people in Hong Kong are <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3128820/vaccine-hesitancy-stopping-hongkongers-getting\">staying away</a> from vaccine clinics – a manifestation of the so-called “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/virologist-christian-drosten-germany-coronavirus-expert-interview\">prevention paradox</a>”.</p> <p>The recent increases in cases and deaths are partly due to the <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/brooks.miner#!/vizhome/MapVariants/Dashboard\">spread of new Covid variants</a>. These are all more transmissible than the original form, first detected in China, and some of them are more lethal. There’s good reason to hope that the vaccines will continue to work against them – or can be updated to do so – but in the meantime the variants, combined with slow vaccine rollout, are pushing fragile health systems to breaking point.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/18/lives-covid-tribute-dead-pandemics\">We need to mark the countless lives Covid has claimed. But how to do it? | Laura Spinney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Without oxygen, for example, it’s impossible to treat a severely ill Covid patient, but there’s a global shortage of the gas. In Peru, where hospitals are in crisis, Médecins Sans Frontières <a href=\"https://www.msf.org/coronavirus-covid-19-leaves-deaths-hospitals-overwhelmed-peru\">reports that</a> “people in many cities queue overnight and sleep in the rough to fill up their oxygen tanks from the few working reservoirs, hoping to take care of their relatives at home”. When a health system is paralysed, non-Covid patients are unable to get treated too, and resources are sucked away from longer-term public health campaigns – meaning that the burden of diseases such as HIV and malaria may increase. Demography is not the only reason for the developing world’s continuing vulnerability, in other words.</p> <p>The Covax facility, which was designed to offset vaccine nationalism, aims to get a first vaccine dose to at least 20% of the population of each participating country by the end of 2021 – though it now looks like it will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/22/revealed-big-shortfall-in-covax-covid-vaccine-sharing-scheme\">fall short of that goal</a>. Even if it hits its target, since less than a quarter of the global population is judged likely to have acquired immunity through natural infection to date, that will leave at least half of it susceptible to Covid in the short term.</p> <p>The disease still mainly targets older people, and though rich countries tend to have proportionally more older people than poorer ones, in absolute terms there are far more elderly people in the developing world. India, for example, has around three times as many people aged 60 or older as Japan, though in terms of its population structure, Japan is considered the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/09/elderly-oldest-population-world-japan/\">oldest country in the world</a>. Burgeoning infection rates in the developing world therefore herald absolute, if not relative, carnage there.</p> <p>We can still hope that the global death toll from Covid in 2021 will not exceed that of 2020 – as the vaccines do their work – even if it’s far from a given. But we can be confident that poorer countries will contribute most of this year’s Covid deaths. That thought alone should give us pause – and in addition we should remember that rich countries are not immune from what happens beyond their shores. Rampant Covid in countries such as India and Brazil will shape the evolution of the virus and could cause new, even more dangerous variants to emerge, which neither our borders nor our vaccines are guaranteed to keep out. That’s why it’s too early to rest on our laurels and why vaccine equity is so important – because this is a pandemic, meaning it’s global.</p> <ul> <li><p>Laura Spinney is a science journalist and author.
